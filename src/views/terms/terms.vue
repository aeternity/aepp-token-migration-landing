            <h1>ÆTERNITY Token Migration Process Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p>
              <dfn>ÆTERNITY</dfn> is a decentralized blockchain that allows scalable smart contracts to interface with real world data (“ÆTERNITY Blockchain”).
              ÆTERNITY has conducted a contribution campaign for developing the ÆTERNITY Blockchain (“Contribution Campaign”).
              <br>
              Yet, ÆTERNITY is about to launch the Genesis Block of the ÆTERNITY Blockchain and will create genesis allocations of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain that will be used on ÆTERNITY Blockchain (“Æ tokens on æternity blockchain”) for the holders of Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain (distributed initially by ÆTERNITY on the Ethereum blockchain subject to the terms and conditions of the Contribution Campaign and following its completion) through a migration process of the Ethereum based Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain.

            By clicking the <em>“I Accept”</em> / <em>“I Agree”</em> / <em>“Continue”</em> / <em>“Next”</em> / <em>"Participate"</em> / <em>“Migrate”</em> buttons or checking the checkbox presented with the Terms, You are, out of your own free will, agreeing that you are taking part at the migration process of the Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain (“Migration Process”), under the Terms set forth in detail in this document at your own risk and these Terms shall be binding between ÆTERNITY and You. You hereby also confirm, due to regulation uncertainties, that you are not a resident in or citizen of the United States of America, the Republic of China, and Singapore. If you are going through the Migration Process for another entity or any third-party, such as the company you work for, or you represent, you hereby warrant that you have legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms as set forth in this document.
            <br>
            N.B. Be aware that for the ensured migration of your Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain and to protect them from inability to use, it is recommended and we strongly advise you to migrate your Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain during phase 0 of the migration process (prior the æternity mainnet launch). Failure to do so might lead to inability to migrate your Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain. This is on your own responsibility and æternity shall not be liable at any time or for any purpose for any failure or delay on your side to migrate your Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain prior the launch of æternity mainnet. Please be also informed that following the launch of æternity genesis block any subsequent migration of Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain might happen through a hard fork only, which æternity aims to kindly ensure for your convenience. However, you should be aware that the adoption of any hard fork on æternity blockchain is in the control of the majority of the mining nodes and æternity will have no control over that process. In case of non-adoption of any of the proposed four hard forks you might not be able to migrate your Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, which might lead to inability to use your tokens. Accordingly, it is recommended and we strongly advise you to migrate all of your Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain during phase 0 of the migration process which will take place prior the launch of æternity mainnet.

                <p>
                  The following Terms (“Terms”) govern the Migration Process, associated with the launch of the Genesis Block of ÆTERNITY Blockchain, that will be conducted by AETERNITY Establishment, based in Liechtenstein (“ÆTERNITY”) for holders of Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain (“Users” collectively, and “User” or “You” individually).
                  ÆTERNITY will create the initial block of ÆTERNITY Blockchain ("Genesis Block") and allocate Æ tokens on æternity blockchain in accordance to Users which participated in the token migration process and burned their Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain by providing their new aeternity blockchain address (public key) which will receive the same amount of native aeternity tokens in exchange for the AE Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
                  This document does not constitute a prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. It is a description of the Migration Process.
                  By taking part at the Migration Process, and/or by receiving, using and holding Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, no form of partnership, joint venture or any similar relationship between the Users, ÆTERNITY and/or other individuals or entities involved with the ÆTERNITY Blockchain  is created.

                <h3>Technical Checks of the Migration Smart Contract System</h3>
                <p>
                  The Migration Smart Contract System used to facilitate Migration Process and the migration of User’s Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain has been, on a reasonable effort basis, examined by technical experts with regard to their functionality. The technical experts have confirmed that the Migration Smart Contract System has, with regard to both accuracy and security, been programmed according to the current state of the art.
                  However, the User understands and accepts that the used software and technology is still in an early development stage and its application of experimental nature which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks. Accordingly, while the examinations performed raise the level of security and accuracy the User understands and accepts that such examinations do not amount to any form of warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Migration Smart Contract Systems are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which could cause, inter alia, the complete loss User’s Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain.

                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p>
                  The User understands and accepts, assumes and acknowledges the risks in connection with the Migration Process of Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain for Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, and/or with the use and ownership of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, as exemplary set forth above and hereinafter. In particular, but not concluding the User understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Risk of software weaknesses: The User understands and accepts that the decentralized cloud concept, the ÆTERNITY Blockchain, Smart Contract Systems including the Migration Smart Contract System and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories (including but not limited to blockchains, Validation Trees, cryptography and game theoretic assumptions related to Proof of Stake or Proof of Work networks) are still in an early development stage and unproven, there is no warranty that the Migration Process and/or the process for allocation, receiving, use and ownership of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain and/or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Regulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the setup of the Migration Smart Contract Systems and/or any other smart contract system and decentralized cloud concept and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the decentralized cloud concept and/or the ÆTERNITY Blockchain, including its termination and the loss of Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain and/or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain for the User.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The User understands and accepts that the Migration Process and/or allocation of the Æ tokens on æternity blockchain and the further development of the ÆTERNITY Blockchain may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from industry and/or the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The User therefore understands that there is no assurance that the User will receive any functionality through the Æ tokens on æternity blockchain held by him.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Risk associated with other applications: The User understands and accepts that the ÆTERNITY Blockchain may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which Æ tokens on æternity blockchain will have no intrinsic value.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Risk of loss of private key: Æ tokens on æternity blockchain may only be accessed using a private key that corresponds to the address at which they are stored. User understands and accepts that if his private key, or the “seed” used to create his address and corresponding private key got lost or stolen, the obtained Æ tokens on æternity blockchain associated with the User’s address will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Risk of theft: The User understands and accepts that the any decentralized cloud concept, the Migration Smart Contract System, any software, the virtual platform created by the ÆTERNITY, the ÆTERNITY Blockchain, the Ethereum network, any smart contract hosted on Ethereum or the ÆTERNITY Blockchain, any wallet, and other technology components or platforms may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that could result in theft or loss of Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain and/or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, impacting the Migration Process or the use or ownership of the Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain and/or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Risk of blockchain mining attacks: The User understands and accepts that, as with other public blockchain based systems that depend upon independent miners, the ÆTERNITY Blockchain may be susceptible to mining attacks including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the decentralized cloud system created by ÆTERNITY, incl. ÆTERNITY Blockchain, expected proper execution and sequencing of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of software computations.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Other risks: Furthermore, the User expressly acknowledges and assumes the risk where hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain and/or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, or the ecosystem, or the Migration Smart Contract System, or User’s wallets, in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, phishing, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing, thus, despite ÆTERNITY’s knowledge and efforts to resolve any such attempt, which may have the result of complete loss of User’s Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain and/or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain. The User agrees and understands such risk, the possible negative consequences that may arise for the User accordingly and warrants and represents that the User shall bear such risk all alone. ÆTERNITY shall not be liable at any time or for any purpose accordingly.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  The User shall be solely responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing the Æ tokens on æternity blockchain once they have been delivered to the User.
                  The User has obtained sufficient information about the Migration Process to make an informed decision and take part of it.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Taxation</h3>
                <p>
                  The User bears the sole responsibility to determine if his participation at the Migration Process, the allocation, use or ownership of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain over time (if any), the sale and purchase of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain and/or any other action or transaction related to the ÆTERNITY Blockcahin have tax implications for him.
                  <br>
                  By participating at the Migration Process, and/or by receiving, using or holding Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, and to the extent permitted by law, the User agrees not to hold any third party (including ÆTERNITY, developers, auditors, contractors or founders) liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the Migration Process, the allocation, use or ownership of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain or any other action or transaction related to the ÆTERNITY Blockchain.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>

                <p>
                  The User acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, the User will not hold ÆTERNITY, any developers, auditors, contractors or founders liable for any and all damages or injury whatsoever caused by or related to the use of, or the inability to use, the Migration Smart Contract System, Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, ÆTERNITY Blockchain, any smart contract system under any cause or action whatsoever of any kind in any jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach of warranty, breach of contract or tort (including negligence) and that developers, auditors, contractors or founders of the Migration Smart Contract Systems, Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, ÆTERNITY Blockchain or ÆTERNITY shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including for loss of profits, goodwill or data, in any way whatsoever arising out of the use of, or the inability to use of the Migration Smart Contract Systems, Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain, Æ tokens on æternity blockchain or ÆTERNITY Blockchain.
                  <br>
                  The User further specifically acknowledges that developers, auditors, contractors or founders of the Migration Smart Contract Systems, Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, ÆTERNITY Blockchain or ÆTERNITY are not liable, and the User agrees not to seek to hold them liable, for the conduct of third parties, including other creators of Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, and that the risk of migration, holding and using Æ tokens on Ethereum blockchain or Æ tokens on æternity blockchain rests entirely with the User.
                  <br>
                  By receiving, holding or using Æ tokens on æternity blockchain, and to the extent permitted by law, the User agrees not to hold any third party (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders) liable for any regulatory implications or liability associated with or arising from the migration, allocation, ownership or use of Æ tokens on æternity blockchain or any other action or transaction related to the ÆTERNITY Blockchain.

                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
                <p>
                  The User agrees that if any portion of these Terms is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.
                  <br>
                  In this case, the contracting Parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision by another provision that comes closest to the economically intended purpose if feasible. The same applies in the case of a regulatory gap.
